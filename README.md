# Earn Your First Billion as Alpha State for Beginers
## Be an EVE Online Trading Expert
* Although EVE Online's complicated systems(trading, mining, planet production etc.) can make novice crazy, it gives us a lot of different choices to play in our own way. EVE Online is also one of the best games, that provide geeks friendly tools.
* At the begining, I searched for some articles that describ how to earn isk quickly. Most of them recommand us to finish some simple tasks to earn about 1 million, then buy a standard industry ship and trade usual goods. Maybe this methods working in the early years that the markets are not ripe. Now there is little profit that you can earn by trading usual goods like ore, planet products etc.
* Before this program, I had tried several tools:
 	* online tools: [evetrade](https://evetrade.space/), [evetradesearch](https://evetradesearch.com/)
	* offline tools: [EVEMarketProphet](https://github.com/georgwacker/EveMarketProphet), [EVERNUS](https://evernus.com/)
* But none of them could privide useful trade routes. Online tools are easy to use, however they require a pair of regions, in order to save server performance. While offline tools need a lot of time to download market data. As you know, time is the most valuable thing in trading. Maybe when you found a good route and drived your small ship there, someone else had already finished the trading.
* So I rewrote a tool to download market data and output useful trades.
* This tool will provide you a document: a CSV file can be parsed by data sheet editors and list all the trades. Most of the columns in the CSV are easy to understand, while the BS is a little complecated.
* If you have a ship that is strong enough to deal with all kinds of pirates, please just ignore the folloing text. Otherwise, you should take BS account.
* BS = buy price / sell price, the boring math is comming. If you are not sure of success, for example, the possibility is 20%, BS must be at least equals 500% not to lose or earn ISK. However, you will still lose 4 ships and some tax.
* So the profit ratio should be the posibility of success ```P * BS - 1```. And don't forget the time to transport(hauling), then maybe this route is not a good one any more.
* There are many articles that talk about hauling and trading, I'm pretty sure that you can find them.

## Make the tool better
* If you like the tool, please leave some response. I will do it better.
